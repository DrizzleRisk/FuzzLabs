# FuzzLabs

**17/06/2016**: Started implementing a new mutation engine. So far it seems to be pretty cool. Feel free to have a look at the code to see what to expect.

**11/04/2016**: The project is **not** dead. Things are happening in the background just a bit slowly as priorities have changed.


FuzzLabs is a modular fuzzing framework which uses a modified version of Sulley as it's core fuzzing engine.
